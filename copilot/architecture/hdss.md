# HDSS Architecture Overview

## Purpose

The Home Delivery Slot Service (HDSS) manages the lifecycle of home delivery slot reservations for Sainsburyâ€™s. It ensures real-time availability, secure booking and releasing, and handles redelivery requests and notifications.

    API -->|Kafka Events| Kafka
    API -->|SNS Events| SNS
    API -->|External REST| Trakm8
    API -->|External REST| FLRS
```

## Component Breakdown

- **API Layer**: Exposes REST endpoints for reservation, release, redelivery, and availability.
- **Service Layer**: Handles business logic, caching, and orchestration of external calls.
- **Persistence Layer**: Uses Spring Data to access the Postgres database.
- **Integration Layer**: Connects to Trakm8 and FLRS for slot and location information.
- **Messaging Layer**: Publishes and consumes events via Kafka and AWS SNS/SQS for notifications and downstream processing.
- **Testing Layer**: Uses WireMock, TestContainers, and Groovy/Spock for comprehensive integration and unit tests.

# Integration Details and Deep Breakdown

## External Integrations

### Trakm8

- Used for slot and route optimization.
- Invoked during reservation and release to validate feasibility and update job data.
- Integration tested via WireMock servers in Groovy/Spock tests.

### FLRS

- Fulfilment Location Reservation Service.
- Used to determine which locations are available for delivery at a given time.
- Queries use GraphQL (`FlrsSameDayAvailabilityCacher.java`).

### Kafka

- Used for publishing events to downstream consumers.
- Notification outbox pattern used for reliability.
- Topics configured for MADE and Confluent clusters.

### SNS/SQS

- Events published for reservation, release, and updates.
- AWS credentials and endpoints configured via environment variables and Spring Boot.

## Testing

- **Integration tests** simulate full flows using WireMock and Docker containers.
- **Unit tests** mock external dependencies and focus on business logic.

## Business Logic Highlights

- **Reservation validation**: Ensures slot is available before booking.
- **Release logic**: Ensures only valid, existing reservations are released.
- **Redelivery**: Re-books or changes the slot for an existing reservation.
- **Caching**: Reduces load on external FLRS service, improves performance.

## Logging & Observability

- Structured logging via Logback and custom utilities (`LogUtils.java`).
- Trace IDs and correlation IDs captured for distributed tracing.
- Metrics published for slot availability and reservation events.
